# daily-workintosh

I have created a daily planner

The date is changed when the website is loaded each day

There are traditional work hours layed out on the screen, with the ability to edit the timeblocks for your schedule.

As the time changes, so to does the color of the timeblock, previous hours, present hour, and future hour.

Struggling to get anything after the 9am hour to save.
